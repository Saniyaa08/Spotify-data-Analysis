Spotify Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring and gaining insights from Spotify music data. The project aims to uncover interesting patterns, trends, and relationships within the Spotify dataset, shedding light on various aspects of music preferences, genres, and user behavior.

🎵 Dataset:
The analysis utilizes a dataset sourced from the Kaggle, which provides a rich collection of information about tracks, artists, albums, and user interactions. The dataset includes attributes such as track features (danceability, energy, valence, etc.), popularity, release dates, and many more.

🔍 Project Goals:
- Explore the Spotify dataset to understand the distribution of music genres, artist popularity, and track attributes.
- Analyze the correlation between track features and user engagement metrics (such as play counts or skips).
- Identify top tracks, artists, and genres based on various criteria (popularity, danceability, etc.).
- Visualize and interpret trends in music preferences across different regions or time periods.

📊 Methodology:
The analysis employs a combination of data manipulation, descriptive statistics, and data visualization techniques using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. Jupyter Notebook is used as the primary environment for executing the analysis code.

🌟 Repository Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the Spotify dataset link or instructions on how to obtain it.
